# Rock Paper Scissors
First functionality/game I've added as a process of setting up a multi-functional discord bot.

### Usage
`$rps`
<br>
Times out after 60 seconds, and a 30 second cool-down to use the command per user.

Inital embed has 3 reactions (🪨, 🧻, & ✂️). Upon choosing one, it will detect your input and generate a random choice by the bot (utilizing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html"> random</a>). Displays your choice & the bots choice, then whether or not you won or lost.
